Auto Mouse Clicker (AMC) is an automatic mouse clicker that allows for a random time to perform the clicks. You can also specify an exact time.

It also allows you to specify the exact location or click to set a random place for clicks in a given area (drawing a square with your mouse). 
The program supports setting different sequences for clicks.
